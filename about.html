<div class="container">
    <p class="has-text-white is-size-4">TXT is a synthwave band formed back in early 2017 by two guys who go by Foo and Bar. Both of them started out making music separately as a hobby. Then in 2016 the two of them met online after finding each others music and discovering that both of them lived in the same area. A few months after knowing each other they finished their first album, HELLO WORLD. After making HELLO WORLD, they were able to quit their day jobs and now make music full time.</p>
